Analises sem alterações; TAC CE realizada no DR Francisco mostra alterações tróficas do parenquima cerebral com acentuação bi-temporal ; estas alterações, embora não específicas, suscitam a hipótese diagnostica de sindrome neurodegenerativo de tipo de doença de alzheimer.

(Medicina Geral e Familiar) / 11:02h 01-Jun-2012 História actual Sintomatologia: Envio aos seus cuidados a paciente aqui identificada, com antecedentes de HTA e dislipidemia e de meningioma paraesfenoidal calcifiado, cuja dimensão desconheço mas terá sido diagnosticado no vosso hospital, e que se terá feito acompanhar de crises convulsivas, dado que a paciente se encontra medicada com valproato de sódio e diazepam desde há longa data, segundo me informa para controlo desses episódios. Esta senhora vem desenvolvendo desde há alguns meses um quadro de lentificação progressiva, com quedas frequentes. Observada particularmente no início de 2011 por um Colega não neurologista, decidiu este instituir Sinemet 25/100 considerando, ao que suponho, tratar-se de um síndroma parkinsónico. Não observei, por me encontrar de licença de maternidade, a paciente a essa data. Entretanto, apresentou-se uma fibrilação auricular que houve necessidade de hipocoagular. A paciente sofreu quedas frequentes, e apresenta marcadas e progressivas dificuldades na marcha. O exame neurológico que lhe efectuei à data da anterior referenmciação à vossa consulta (7/2011) e que a paciente perdeu por morada errada e não recepção da convocatória para a mesma, revelava a p+resença de lentificação psicomotora, tremor vestigial fino bilateral dos membros em repouso, com marcada intensificação postural, e ausência de rigidez. A bradicinésia de movimentos que observo parece-me mais atribuível à patologia OA do joelho que apresenta do que a causas neurológicas.

Na apreciaçao encefalica destaca-se uma hipodensidade corticosubcortical frontal supra opercular direita com extensao profunda ate ao contorno ependimario do corno frontal do corno ventricular, tendo ainda uma pequena extensao subinsular anterior na capsula externa e possivelmente no nucleo lenticular homonimo, e uma extensao na corona radiata direita atingindo-lhe o segmento anterior. Imagem lacunar lenticular direita um pouco mais posteriormente. Aspecto retractil significativo com dilataçao passiva do corno frontal direito e do corpo ventricular, e ainda de sulcos corticais vizinhos. Para alem deste aspecto ha um alargamento difuso dos espaços sulco-cisternais e dos ventriculos, mas sem outras assimetrias nem dismorfias significativas e o parenquima nao apresenta outras alteraçoes densitometricas focais dignas de referencia. Estes aspectos sao interpretaveis, no contexto clinico referindo de lesao pos-traumatica, como provaveis focos de contusao, embora tambem possam traduzir sequelas de lesao vascular em territorio silvico.¿ # TAC CE (16/09/2010) » ¿Identifica-se lesao parenquimatosa sequelar cortico-subcortical e lenticulo-capsulo - caudada a dta, com alargamento passivo do corno frontal e do corpo do ventriculo lateral homolateral, de provavel etiologia vascular. Ventriculomegalia moderada, incluindo cornos temporais, desproporcional ao padrao sulcal das convexidades cerebrais mas encontrando-se ainda permeaveis os sulcos corticais e nao existindo sinais de edema transependimario, fazendo-se o diagnostico diferencial entre atrofia subcorticale ventriculomegalia compensada.

Em C5-C6 existe procidencia discal postero-mediana e osteofitose marginal posterior, podendo exercer ligeiro compromisso da medula cervical. Associa-se estenose foraminal bilateral.

No SU fez TAC CE e analises com hemograma, coagulaçao, f.renal, hepatica, ionograma, PCR, urina 2 que estavam bem. Apenas no TAC-CE mostrou ""existencia de lesao extraconica orbitaria ocupando espaço, anterior, superior e interna a dta, com calcificaçoes grosseiras"" e sugeria estudo dirigido á orbita. O Sr teve alta do SU para o Medico de família. Veio ter comigo mantendo disestesia intermitente da face, falta de paladar e oscilaçoes da acuidade visual do OD, sem dor, sem ardor, apenas lacrimejo ocasional bilateral. Pedi TAC da orbita dta, que revelou ¿Na vertente superior interna da órbita direita observamos lesão espontaneamente hiperdensa, com algumas catcíticações nodulares, condicionando ligeira prc)'pcse do globo ocular desse lado. Esta alteração poderá traduzir malformação vascular venosa com pequenos flebolitos, sugerindo-se estudo complementar por ressonância magnética, caso clinicamente se justifique. A lesão situa-se na proximidade do complexo músculo recto superior/levantador da pálpebra, que não nos parecem envolvidos. Não há outras alterações dos músculos orbitários. Aspectos normais do nervo óptico e globo ocular. Não há alterações destrutivas das paredes ósseas da órbita direita. Aspectos normais da órbita esquerda.¿ Ao longo deste período (desde Março passado, em que se iniciaram as queixas) nunca teve falta de força muscular, mas apenas disestesia intermitente.

A D. Joana Rodrigues manteve a mesma atitude mas em maio deste ano a situação agravou-se, e após estada no Canadá com o outro filho, a nora e o filho com quem reside em FFerro vieram à consulta preocupados com a situação presente: ""segundo a nora, ainda faz limpezas no centro comercial, mas a nora tem medo que se perca quando vem a pé do CC para casa - já aconteceu uma vez não saber onde estava; por vezes esquece-se do fogão ligado; é muito repetitiva, quando se fala com ela, parece não ouvir, por vezes não entende o que se lhe diz, não pode ser contrariada , fica muito nervosa.faz confusão com os produtos de higiene - troca""; ""segundo o filho e a nora do Canada: sentiram que estava confusa,p vezes não sabia que estava no Canadá, só falava de coisas antigas, muito implicativa e esquecida das coisas do dia a dia"".

Em termos de observação neurologica e oftalmologica não se evidenciaram alterações significativas, mas a cortina de Hess foi compatível com paresia do nervo abducente esq. O quadro foi sugestivo de mononeuropatia craniana, não se tendo excluído a hipótese de pequena lesão vascular do tronco (não aguda e de pequenas dimensões). Em termos de investigação no SU o doente fez TC-CE que não tinha alterações, ECG com ritmo sinusal e análises que não demonstram alterações significativas. Iniciou AAS e, de acordo com pedido da Dr.ª Claúdia Pereira que o observou no SU, realizou: - Análises: VS 60, HbA1c 5.7, homocisteina N, cálcio 8.9, fósforo 3, magnésio 1.9, TSH 3.48, FT4 1.05, VDRL neg, HIV neg, ac fólico 4.5, vit B12 1000; elet prot sem alteração dos valores, mas com gráfico sugestivo de possível gamapatia monoclonal. - Realizou imunofixação das proteínas no soro e na urina, tendo-se detectado gamapatia monoclonal IgG/Lambda. - Doppler vasos pescoço (17/4/2015): Permeabilidade dos eixos carotideos e sub-clavios sem sinais de lesão focal hemodinamicamente significativa. Vertebrais permeáveis em V2 com calibre e fluxo diminuido à esquerda por provavel hipoplasia.

Também presente uma atrofia temporomesial bilateral e aparentemente proporcionada com o grau de atrofia cortical referida. Os ventrículos são praticamente normodimensionados registando-se apenas uma dilatação mais evidente na extremidade anterior dos cornos temporais dos ventrículos laterais, bilateral.

Efectivamente verifico na PDS que existem contactos de consultas de neuropediatria em 2001 e 2002, mas sem informação clínica visível. Em 2014 recorreu à minha consulta referindo que ao longo dos anos tem episódios de convulsões que descreve como tónico-clónicas generalizadas ocasionais, espaçadas de anos, as quais não terá valorizado. Refere que num desses episódios terá recorrido ao SU do HGO (o único registos que consigo verificar na PDS é de 20/1/2011 onde nos diagnósticos da alta se encontra epilepsia e entorse do tornozelo). Na altura referia episódio recente, enquanto estava a fazer esforços no trabalho (trabalha na construção civil). Refere que viu tudo branco e depois perdeu os sentidos, referindo que os colegas descrevem que teve movimentos involuntários dos braços e das pernas de curta duração. Não me consegue precisar quanto tempo esteve inconsciente, mas não terá sido muito tempo. Nega mordedura da língua ou incontinência de esfíncteres. Nessa altura realizou analises e TC-CE que não mostraram alterações e foi referenciado a consulta de neurologia, que foi marcada para 15/6/2015, a que faltou por não ter sido notificado. Vem novamente à minha consulta, desta vez com a namorada, referindo que há dois dias, à noite, depois de vir do velório de um amigo, estava com a namorada deitado na cama a ver TV, e de forma súbita o João ficou parado, com o olhar fixo, sem responder, durante cerca de 5 minutos. Depois voltou a reagir durante 2-3 minutos e voltou ao mesmo estado, com revirar dos olhos e com os membros esticados e com algum tremor. Este segundo episodio também durou cerca de 5 minutos. Quando começou a reagir estava sonolento. Nega incontinência de esfincteres. O João não se recorda de nada, sendo a primeira recordação da altura em que os bombeiros já estavam em sua casa. Foi ao SU HGO, onde terá realizado TC-CE e analises (a que não tive acesso), que estariam normais.

Rita, de 86 anos, por suspeita de síndrome demencial no início. Em Maio/2016 a neta veio com a utente à consulta referindo que no último ano têm notado a D. Luísa mais esquecida. Começou a fazer alguns disparates quando cozinha, algo que não era frequente dado ter sido cozinheira (ex. colocar chouriço na canja, fazer a sopa demasiado consistente, ter peixe no frigorifico que já está degradado e dizer que está bom para cozinhar). Deixou de conseguir gerir a medicação (a filha actualmente coloca os comprimidos em caixas e mesmo assim já detectaram que se engana). Pergunta várias vezes a mesma coisa. Refere que limpou a cozinha ou outra divisão e continua tudo sujo. Esquece-se sobretudo das coisas mais recentes. Nunca aconteceu não conhecer as pessoas. Nunca aconteceu perder-se. À observação: TA 126-74 77 AC rítmica AP N Peso estável ENS sem alterações aparentes MMS 20 (analfabeta) » estável entre Maio e Agosto/2016 Inicialmente associou-se as queixas ao síndrome depressivo reactivo ao falecimento da filha em França, tendo sido medicada nesse sentido. No decorrer da investigação foi detectado um hipotiroidismo subclínico com AAT negativo; dado o contexto optou por medicar e aguarda resposta da terapêutica. Apesar destas medidas e de o MMS estar estável, a família tem notado um agravamento progressivo do quadro, pelo que peço avaliação em consulta de Neurologia para aferição diagnostica e terapêutica.

Foi pedida consulta de neurologia em 2013 tendo sido avaliado pelo colega Dr Pedro Rodrigues, o qual pediu TAC CE. Desde essa altura o utente não voltou a ser observado. O estado clinico agravou-se com confusão mental,alteração da memória e marcha por petit-pas. Em Setembro de 2016 sofreu internamento no HGO por : Síndrome febril de origem indeterminada Infecção urinária por Staphylococcus epidermidis Doença cerebrovascular / Síndrome demencial (?) Durante o internamento fez vários exames dos quais destaco; # TC CE (09/09/2016): Ausência de colecções hemáticas intra / Extraaxiais. Sem evidencia de lesões traumáticas encefálicas. Não se observam sinais precoces de enfarte isquémico. Padrão de leucoareiose, coexistindo lacuans vasculares isquémicas nucleo-capsulares e talamicas bilaterais. Espaços cisternais basais e sistema ventricular supra e infra-tentorial e sulcos corticais permeáveis, alargados, em relação com atrofia cerebral difusa de predomínio subcortical. Ausencia de desvios das estruturas medianas. Sem herniações encefálicas. Regularidade dos constituintes ósseos da base e calote cranianas. # TC coluna vertebral (09/09/2016): Curvatura escoliótica sinistro-convexa lombar. Ausencia de aspectos fracturários ósseos ou incongruencias facetárias dos elementos constituintes do ráquis dorsal, que estabelecem entre si relações anatómicas mútuas na posiçãode estudo, definindo canal raquidiano central de dimensões normais. Sequela de laminectomia bilateral de L5. Acentuadas alterações degenerativas interapofisárias posteriores a determinar subluxação e consequente desvio listésico anterior de L4 sobre L5 - espondilolistesis L4/L5 (grau I/IV).

Efectivamente verifico na PDS que existem contactos de consultas de neuropediatria em 2001 e 2002, mas sem informação clínica visível. Em 2014 recorreu à minha consulta referindo que ao longo dos anos tem episódios de convulsões que descreve como tónico-clónicas generalizadas ocasionais, espaçadas de anos, as quais não terá valorizado. Refere que num desses episódios terá recorrido ao SU do HGO (o único registos que consigo verificar na PDS é de 20/1/2011 onde nos diagnósticos da alta se encontra epilepsia e entorse do tornozelo). Na altura referia episódio recente, enquanto estava a fazer esforços no trabalho (trabalha na construção civil). Refere que viu tudo branco e depois perdeu os sentidos, referindo que os colegas descrevem que teve movimentos involuntários dos braços e das pernas de curta duração. Não me consegue precisar quanto tempo esteve inconsciente, mas não terá sido muito tempo. Nega mordedura da língua ou incontinência de esfíncteres. Nessa altura realizou analises e TC-CE que não mostraram alterações e foi referenciado a consulta de neurologia, que foi marcada para 15/6/2015, a que faltou por não ter sido notificado. Vem novamente à minha consulta, desta vez com a namorada, referindo que há dois dias, à noite, depois de vir do velório de um amigo, estava com a namorada deitado na cama a ver TV, e de forma súbita o João ficou parado, com o olhar fixo, sem responder, durante cerca de 5 minutos. Depois voltou a reagir durante 2-3 minutos e voltou ao mesmo estado, com revirar dos olhos e com os membros esticados e com algum tremor. Este segundo episodio também durou cerca de 5 minutos. Quando começou a reagir estava sonolento. Nega incontinência de esfincteres. O João não se recorda de nada, sendo a primeira recordação da altura em que os bombeiros já estavam em sua casa. Foi ao SU HGO, onde terá realizado TC-CE e analises (a que não tive acesso), que estariam normais.

Contudo, até ao momento, não se apuraram episódios de desorientação auto e alopsiquica, nem alterações comportamentais, ainda que vá confabulando quando não consegue encontrar objectos que guardou em locais incorrectos (acusa o marido de ter escondido os objectos). Numa primeira fase uma vez que se considerou a existência de síndrome depressivo concomitante (por anedonia e avolia), iniciou-se tratamento para excluir a possibilidade de Pseudodemência, no entanto, apesar da melhoria da sintomatologia depressiva, manteve-se o padrão de declínio cognitivo. Na avaliação em consulta destaca-se a incapacidade de realização do teste do relógico, bem como alteração no MMSE na área do cálculo, desenho e evocação diferida de palavras; Fez avaliação analítica para excluir causas secundárias de Demência bem como TC de Crânio que se transcreve. TC Crânio: ¿Calcificações ateroscleróticas exuberantes nos sifões carotídeos. Na apreciação encefálica destaca-se o alargamento difuso nos espaços sulcocisternais sobretudo na alta convexidade frontoparietal configurando um padrão de atrofia cortical difusa moderada. Alargamento ligeiro do corno temporal direito na sua extremidade. Este aspecto conjuntamente com o alargamento das fendas coroideias poderá iniciar uma atrofia temporomesial.

Acompanhada a consulta com a filha com quem tem relação distante e que refere em cada consulta que não tem a disponibilidade necessária para acompanhar adequadamente a mãe. Desconhece se faz refeições adequadas, por exemplo. Desde que conheço a família e foi necessário iniciar insulina, conseguiu-se articular entre a filha e uma neta a administração por visita diária de uma delas. AP: - Glaucoma - HTA, dislipidemia, DM tipo2 insulino-tratada há 3 meses, ainda não controlada HDA: A família refere alterações mnésicas e desorientação desde o inicio de 2016, com períodos de flutuação mas agravamento progressivo. Inicialmente havia grande confusão com medicação que já é orientada pela filha. Numa das consultas não me reconheceu nem se recordava de já ter vindo a USF. Teve um episodio de ir em collants ao mercado. Actualmente já recusa sair de casa desacompanhada- depreendo que por receio de desorientação embora negue quando questionada. Está incapaz das AVDs e autocuidados. Por vezes a filha chega a casa e esta sem cuecas. Iniciei sertralina no inicio das queixas mnésicas por me parecer exitir componente depressivo importante pelo contexto de vida do filho, mas abandonou a terapêutica, que reiniciei hoje.

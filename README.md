> Our goal is to develop an advanced algorithm that predicts the outcome of triage referrals in the Neurology department of HGO. By leveraging historical patient data and employing natural language processing techniques, our project aims to provide accurate predictions for new referrals. The algorithm's predictions serve as valuable suggestions to doctors, enhancing the decision-making process and ultimately improving triage efficiency.

## Usage


> All the necessary functions to run the model are available on the &#34;src&#34; folder. To run the final model the user should connect to the database via &#34;src/db/connection.py&#34; and run the &#34;final_model()&#34; function that can be found on &#34;src/modelling_pipelines/final_model_pipeline.py&#34;. 
> For more a more in-depth look, the features creation functions are available under &#34;src/pre_processing&#34;. They are organized by category, following the different NLP analasys that were explored. 
> Aditionnaly, some working notebooks with visual representions of the analysis are available under the &#34;notebooks&#34; folder.
